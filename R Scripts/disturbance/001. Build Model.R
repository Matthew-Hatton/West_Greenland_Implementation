## Following procedure conceptualised by Dr. Douglas Spiers, build a linear model to predict the seabed disturbance rates

rm(list = ls()) # reset
library(MiMeMo.tools) # everything we need


prop_disturbed <- read.csv("./Objects/physics/Prop disturbed.csv") %>%  # proportional disturbance rates for different regional implementations of StrathE2E for mud, sand, and gravel sediment types in the inshore and offshore regions
 filter(!region == "CS" | !shore == "in" | !sediment == "mud") # remove outlier

mod0 <- lm(formula = log(dist) ~ depth + sediment + shore, data = prop_disturbed) # build model
summary(mod0)

mod <- step(mod0) # suggests we can remove sediment

mod <- lm(formula = log(dist) ~ depth + shore,data = prop_disturbed)
summary(mod)

plot(mod)

foo <- data.frame(depth = c(40,600),
                  shore = c("in","off"))

bar <- predict(object = mod,newdata = foo)
